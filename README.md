Introduction_to_Macroecological Data Analysis in R
====================================================

Developed for University of Copenhagen Macroecology & Community Ecology Masters course 2014

3 hour crash course in R

Exercises are provided as scripts and as word documents

Word documents recommended for hand outs so students have to type commands themselves - less likely to copy and paste and not understand (hopefully!)

Powerpoint designed to be used at the beginning and in between exercises.

Example data are from:

Keith, S.A. Kerswell, A.P. & Connolly, S.R. (2014) Global diversity of macroalgae: environmental conditions explain less variation in the tropics. Global Ecology & Biogeography 23(5):517-529
